# Rainone Software
Code for the main site. This code base should include all the styling and svelte files for the website but NOT
- build artifacts
- production configs (sample dev configs okay)
- text content
# Development
Code is based on guide [here|https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte].
# Deployment
This site runs on AWS using Amplify, Lambda and DynamoDB. Check out the blog for notes (TODO: write this up)
